# pronto-pup
This is a couple of projects that I worked on during my senior year in college. Earlier in the year, I came up with what I called the "Pronto Pup Problem", which was really just a number of producer-consumer buffers to simulate one of the Pronto Pup (corn dog) stands that are found at the yearly Minnesota State Fair. By changing the initial variables that described the stand, different simulations could be carried out, and a "score" determined for each set of variables.

The first was for an Artificial Intelligence class, and I used a few AI methods in C to determine what might be best performing of them to find the best score. It was made in a sequential manner operating in a single thread.

The second was for a Parallel Programming class, which used C and CUDA to (hopefully) take advantage of massive parallelism available on NVIDIA graphics cards. It would again use AI methods to find a best score.

Writeups for each methodology are in the PDFs.
